# BNF WebScraping

## How to:

This program extracts information from the British National Formulary to aid cleaning and pricing medications reported in clinical trials.
The BNF website allows the researcher to receive the most up to date pricing information on any given medication licensed in the UK. As medication prices change constantly, it is important to have this information online so that it can be readily updated.

The aim of this program is to complement the BNF and allow researchers to extract various information from the BNF and format this in one dataset. Running this program prevents a researcher searching the BNF website each time medication information is required.

To run this program simply copy and paste the following code into your R console:

`library(shiny) runGitHub("WebScrape", "willking98")`
